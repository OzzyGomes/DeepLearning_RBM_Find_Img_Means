<h1>RBM and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) for MNIST Dataset</h1>

<p>This repository contains R code to train Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) on the MNIST dataset. RBM is a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning, while DBN is a hierarchical model that combines multiple RBMs for more accurate results.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To use this code, you will need to install the <code>RBM</code> package developed by TimoMatzen. You can install it directly from GitHub using the following code:</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This code allows you to train RBM and DBN models on the MNIST dataset. RBM can be used for unsupervised learning tasks, and DBN combines multiple RBMs to achieve more accurate results. Experiment with different hyperparameters and training options to optimize your results for various machine learning tasks.</p>
